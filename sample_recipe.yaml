# Can be used to kill time between recipe steps
- pause: 
    time: 30 # minutes

# Add a fixed mass of glucose
- bolus:
    target_mass: 30 # grams

# Add an arbitrary mass of glucose at an increasing/decreasing rate until target is hit
- linear:
    target_rate: 30 # steps/min

# Feed in glucose at a given volumetric rate for a given time
- timed:
    rate: 30 # steps/min
    time: 30 # minutes
